# MarkStocks-WavePeel-Books
A **peeling the wave** refers to the way a wave breaks and progresses, typically from one side to the other, creating a "peeling" effect as the wave's crest moves along its length. This is ideal for surfers because it allows them to ride the wave horizontally across its face, rather than simply dropping straight down. Peeling waves provide more rideable surface area and ride time, enabling longer and more dynamic rides.

A **peeling wave** reveals its face gradually, and a surfer rides it in sections rather than all at once, planning and following the wave as it peels. Similarly, when coding, our thought process involves breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts and addressing each step methodicallyâ€”just like riding along a peeling wave:
- **Problem-Solving**: We help you to think to dissecting a problem into smaller, manageable parts to understand and solve it more effectively.
- **Innovation**: We help you to think to master the process of uncovering new insights by systematically removing superficial or outdated practices. The application of Occam's razor (look it up)
- **Analysis**: We help you to think delving deeper into a topic, starting with surface-level understanding and gradually working toward foundational truths.

# Code Repository
As an adjuct to our books we provide a **repository** for design thinking tools, pseudocode,  and the code examples in various programming languages targeted in our WavePeel book series. 

Each WavePeel book is designed to help learners develop using pseudocode, and / or  other design methods,  and then translate it all into the programming language syntax of the readers choice.

For each of the WavePeel books, this  **repository**  is where you will find our example PseudoCode questions and example answers from the book. 

**In addition:**  You will find various extra example questions and sometimes the answer beyond the book content. We call these **extended examples** and, they are designed to encourage the reader to move forward with more intersting problems.
