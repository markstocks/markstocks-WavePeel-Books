# markstocks-WavePeel-Books
A repository for pseudocode and code examples in various programming languages from the WavePeel book series, designed to help learners develop pseudocode and translate it into the programming language syntax of their choice.

For any WavePeel book this is where you will find our example PseudoCode and examples. You will find additional examples beyond the various books. We call these extended examples.
